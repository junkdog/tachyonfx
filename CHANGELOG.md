# Changelog

### Added
- `fx::offscreen_buffer()`: wraps an existing effect and redirects its rendering
  to a separate buffer.  This allows for more complex effect compositions and can
  improve performance for certain types of effects.
- `BufferRenderer` trait: enables rendering of one buffer onto another with offset support.
This allows for more complex composition of UI elements and effects.
- fn `blit_buffer()`: copies the contents of a source buffer onto a destination buffer with a specified offset.


## tachyonfx 0.4.0 - 2024-07-14

### Added
- `CellFilter::PositionFn`: filter cells based on a predicate function.
- `fx::slide_in()` and `fx::slide_out()`: slides in/out cells by "shrinking" the cells horizontally or
  vertically along the given area.
- `fx::effect_fn_buf()`: to create custom effects operating on a `Buffer` instead of `CellIterator`.
- `Shader::reset`: reinitializes the shader(*) to its original state. Previously, the approach was to
  clone the shader from a copy of the original instance, occasionally resulting in unintended behavior
  when certain internal states were expected to persist through resets.

*: _Note that "shader" here is used loosely, as no GPU is involved, only terminal cells._

### Breaking
- `fx::resize_area`:  signature updated with `initial_size: Size`, replacing the u16 tuple.

### Fixed
- `fx::translate()`: translate can now move out-of-bounds.
- `fx::translate()`: hosted effects with extended duration no longer end prematurely.
- `fx::effect_fn()`: effect state now correctly resets between iterations when using `fx::repeat()`, `fx::repeating()`
  and `fx::ping_pong()`. 
- `fx::resize_area()`: fixed numerous problems.

## tachyonfx 0.3.0 - 2024-06-30

### Changed
- `fx::effect_fn()`: updated the function signature to include an initial state parameter and `ShaderFnContext`
  context parameter. The custom effect closure now takes three parameters: mutable state, `ShaderFnContext`, and a
  cell iterator.
- `ratatui` updated to 0.27.0. This is also the minimum version required for tachyonfx.

## tachyonfx 0.2.0 - 2024-06-23

### Added
- `fx::effect_fn()`: creates custom effects from user-defined functions.
- Add `CellFilter::AnyOf(filters)` and `CellFilter::NoneOf(filters)` variants.
- Implemented `ToRgbComponents` trait for `Color` to standardize extraction of RGB components.

### Fixed
- `fx::translate()`: replace `todo!()` in cell_selection().
- 16 and 256 color spaces no longer output black when interpolating to a different color.

## tachyonfx 0.1.0 - 2024-06-20

Initial release of the library.
